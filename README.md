# guessing_game

My first rust application. Built using cargo.

This repo contains a guessing game where the player must guess a randomly generated number. 

If the guess is too high or too low, feedback will be provided and another guess will be allowed. 

The program loops until the user successfully guesses the number. 

The case where the user enters a non integer value as the guess is handled and will not cause the program to crash.
